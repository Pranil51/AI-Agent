As of 2024, the U.S. goods trade deficit with China was $270.4 billion, with U.S. imports from China totaling $401.4 billion and U.S. exports to China at $131 billion.\n\nTo provide more context and historical perspective:\n\n1. In 2018, the total U.S.-China bilateral trade in goods was $659.8 billion, with U.S. exports at $120.3 billion and imports at $539.5 billion. This resulted in a goods trade deficit of $419.2 billion.\n\n2. From 2018 to 2024, we can observe that while the trade deficit has decreased (from $419.2 billion to $270.4 billion), it remains substantial.\n\n3. China continues to be the country with which the United States has the largest trade deficit.\n\nIt's important to note that these figures primarily reflect trade in goods. The trade balance in services, while not as large, also plays a role in the overall economic relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade relationship is complex and has been influenced by various factors over the years, including:\n\n1. Economic policies of both countries\n2. Global economic conditions\n3. Trade agreements and disputes\n4. Currency exchange rates\n5. Comparative advantages in different industries\n\nWhile the trade deficit has decreased since 2018, it remains a significant economic and political issue. The composition of trade, the balance between goods and services, and the broader economic strategies of both nations continue to shape this important bilateral trade relationship." gaps_acknowledged='While this response provides more historical context by including data from 2018, there are still some information gaps:\n\n1.

In 2024, U.S. exports to China fell by 2.9% and U.S. imports from China rose by 2.7% over 2023. The 2024 U.S. trade deficit with China increased by about $16 billion over 2023. (**Figure 1**.)  **Services****:** In 2024, China accounted for 4.8% ($55 billion) of U.S. services exports and 2.6% ($21.9 billion) of U.S. services imports. (**Figure 2.**) Top U.S. exports to China are travel, technology and IP licensing, and transport.  **Sales:** In 2023, sales in China by majority U.S.-owned affiliates were $475.2 billion. In 2022 (latest available) U.S. sales by majority PRC-owned affiliates were $78.6 billion.  **Investment:** In 2024, the U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) stock in China was $122.9 billion, and China's FDI stock in the United States was $34.0 billion. (**Figure 3**.) In 2024, China accounted for 0.6% of total FDI stock in the United States; China accounted for 1.8% of U.S. FDI stock abroad.  Investments in China by U.S. private equity (PE) funds fell from $140 billion in 2019 to under $1 billion in 2024. In 2025 China's PE market has shifted to mostly domestic capital.  According to the Department of the Treasury, as of June 2025 U.S. investors held $359.1 billion in PRC (mainland China and Hong Kong) securities; PRC holdings of U.S. securities were $1.8 trillion; and the PRC was the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries ($999 billion) after Japan ($1.1 trillion).

In January 2025, President Trump issued the *America First Trade Policy**.* It directed a review of trade issues that affect the PRC to include the U.S. trade deficit; foreign trade, currency, and tax practices; U.S. trade remedies; U.S. *de minimis* imports; and fentanyl trade. Specific to China, the memorandum directed a review of PRC adherence to the *Phase One* trade deal; the four-year review of Section 301 actions on China;legislation on most-favored nation (MFN) tariff treatment for China; export controls; and rulemaking on connected vehicle technologies and outbound investment to China. PRC industrial policies supported the development of emerging technology products, such as EVs, that are coming to market, and driving overcapacity in China as well as PRC exports.  \n**Tariffs:** The executive branch's use of tariffs as a tool to advance trade, foreign policy, and economic goals has prompted debates about congressional trade authorities and oversight over U.S. trade policy and the costs and benefits of using tariffs to address PRC practices of concern. [H.R. 694](/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/694)/[S. 206](/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/206) would revoke MFN tariff treatment for the PRC.  \nThe executive branch has taken several tariff actions on PRC imports. In 2018, under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. §2411), the USTR concluded that the PRC engaged in forced technology transfer, cyber-enabled theft of U.S. IP and trade secrets, discriminatory and non-market licensing practices, and state-funded strategic acquisitions of U.S. assets. In response, the USTR imposed tariffs at rates that ranged from 7.5% to 25% on about $370 billion worth of U.S. imports from China. The PRC countered with tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. trade. In 2020, the United States and the PRC signed a *Phase One* deal, which addressed some issues but did not resolve many of the issues USTR had raised. In May 2024, the USTR issued the results of its review of tariffs; it extended most tariffs and raised tariffs by 25% to 100% on some goods (e.g., EVs and batteries, medical products, semiconductors, ship-to-shore cranes, solar cells, and steel and aluminum). See CRS In Focus IF12125, [*Section 301 and China: The U.S.-China Phase One Trade Deal*](/crs-product/IF12125).  \nTwo other Section 301 investigations and actions on China involve semiconductors and shipping and shipbuilding. See CRS In Focus IF12666, [*Section 301 and China: Shipping and Shipbuilding Issues*](/crs-product/IF12666), and CRS In Focus IF12958, [*Section 301 and China: Mature-Node Semiconductors*](/crs-product/IF12958)."), Document(id='2bcfcf9d-abe5-4b73-b957-eeda3c0ab01c', metadata={'link': 'https://www.statista.com/statistics/939402/us-china-trade-deficit/?srsltid=AfmBOoqJ3lPBaMQSZQyOifBmBHy21uzKSVIfjwB6Q-o5ScRWDXbjJ9Uj', 'source': 'https://www.statista.com/statistics/939402/us-china-trade-deficit/?srsltid=AfmBOoqJ3lPBaMQSZQyOifBmBHy21uzKSVIfjwB6Q-o5ScRWDXbjJ9Uj', 'source_reliability': 0.5, 'date': 'Nov 19, 2025', 'headers': 'U.S.-China trade deficit 2014-2024', 'chunk_position': 1, 'query_id': 1}, page_content='Published by  \n[Bruna Rocco](/aboutus/our-research-commitment/4099/bruna-rocco)  \nBruna Rocco  \nResearch Expert E-commerce  \n[Get in touch with us now](/contact/)  \n,  \nNov 19, 2025  \nThis statistic shows the United States goods trade deficit with China from 2014 to 2024.

According to China’s own data, its exports as a share of the U.S. import market have only declined by 2.5 percentage points, less than one-third of the decline shown in the U.S. data. In fact, China’s data says that its exports actually *increased* by $91.2 billion, to $524 billion (exports were even higher during the pandemic, but have since declined). Moreover, while the U.S.’s reported trade deficit with China from the beginning of 2018 to 2024 declined from $375 billion to $295 billion, China’s reported trade surplus with the U.S. *increased* from $278 billion to $360 billion.  \nWhat’s going on here? Mechanically, as illustrated in the chart below, there has been a huge shift in the discrepancy between what the U.S. says it imports from China and what China says it exports to the U.S. (hereafter called the “import gap”). Simply stated, the U.S. is saying it buys from China a lot less than what China says it is selling. The chart shows in solid red this gap and in dashed red the average gap before 2018. A downward shift clearly began in 2018, with the difference between the average line and the observed data in 2024 amounting to $158 billion. There has been only a partial offset from a larger positive gap with the rest of the world, as shown in the solid and dashed blue lines, with data through 2023. As a result, there appears to be more than $100 billion in “missing imports” headed for the U.S. when comparing the U.S. and the rest of the world’s data, virtually all of which can be attributed to China.  \nThe U.S.’s ‘Missing Imports’  \n![Line chart tracking the discrepancy between U.S. reported imports from China (red solid), U.S. reported imports from the world excluding China (blue solid), the U.S. – China average (red dashed), and the U.S. – world average (blue dashed), in billions of U.S. dollars (vertical axis) from 2012 to 2024 (horizontal axis); chart shows a large increase in the discrepancy between the U.S. and Chinese imports starting after 2019. ](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/LSE_2025-china-new-trade-war_clark_ch2.png?w=442)  \nSources: U.S. Census; China General Administration of Customs; IMF Direction of Trade Statistics via Haver and CEIC.\nNotes: The red and blue solid lines show the difference between U.S. reported imports from China and the world excluding China and those trading partners’ reported exports to the U.S. The dashed lines show the respective averages from 2013 to 2017.  \nWhile it is normal for there to be discrepancies between countries’ mirrored import and export data, the shifts observed with China are much too large and persistent to be explained by normal variation or technical factors. The scatter plot below shows the average and 2023 values of the U.S. import gap for all of the U.S.’s trade partners. China is clearly an extreme outlier, both in terms of size and direction of movement (from positive to negative, into the lower right corner). There are notable offsetting movements in Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, Vietnam, but these are much smaller than China’s. The trade gap with China is *not* primarily driven by a shifting of trade through third countries. Such shifting appears to be accurately reflected in U.S. statistics, with some partial exceptions. Rather, it is an issue of measurement.  \nChina Is an Extreme Outlier  \n![Scatter plot chart tracking the 2023 import gap in billions of U.S. dollars (vertical axis) against the pre-trade war average import gap in billions of U.S. dollars (horizontal axis); compared to Taiwan, Ireland, Vietnam, and Hong Kong, China is a distant outlier.](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/LSE_2025_china-new-trade-war_ch4.png?w=442)  \nSource: IMF Direction of Trade Statistics.\nNotes: “Gap” refers to the U.S.’s reported imports from a country minus the country’s reported exports to the U.S. The horizontal axis shows the average value of the gap before 2018, and the vertical axis shows the value of the gap in 2023; for example, for China, the gap averaged +$17 billion before 2018 and almost -$80 billion in 2023. The gap in Ireland primarily reflects corporate tax minimization strategies and is not relevant for the discussion in this post.  \n#### **Export Taxes in China, U.S. Tariffs, and *De Minimis* Distort the Trade Picture**')]

Customs data showed that China’s global trade surplus surged nearly 20 per cent year-on-year to almost $1.2 trillion in 2025. Exports stood at $3.77 trillion, while imports were valued at $2.58 trillion.Officials in Beijing attributed the export strength to diversification efforts. Wang Jun, vice-minister of the General Administration of Customs, said supportive policies and the depth of China’s industrial base helped offset external headwinds.“Our trading partners are increasingly diversified, and our risk-resilience has significantly strengthened,” Wang told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.Economists, however, cautioned against extrapolating the trend too far. Gary Ng, senior Asia-Pacific economist at French investment bank Natixis, said external demand may moderate as global monetary easing cycles approach their limits.“I think Chinese exports will continue to grow in 2026, but at a slightly slower pace,” Ng told the newspaper.  \n![author](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/83033472.cms)  \n**About the Author**[TOI Business Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-TOI-Business-Desk-479263446.cms)  \nThe TOI Business Desk is a vigilant and dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant business news from around the world to readers of The Times of India.
